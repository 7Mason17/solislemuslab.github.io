# Postdoctoral research position in phylogenetic networks

### Overview 

- **What:** Postdoctoral position in the inference of phylogenetic networks. Full-time, two years of funding with potential for extension based on performance/funding
- **Where:** [Wisconsin Institute for Discovery](https://wid.wisc.edu) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison at [Solis-Lemus lab](https://solislemuslab.github.io/)
- **When:** ASAP (negotiable)
- **Minimum qualifications:** Strong quantitative background and programming skills. Candidates must hold a PhD at the time of the appointment

### More details

#### Research project
This project will contribute to the fundamental research of the Network of Life by producing novel statistical theory on the inference of complex phylogenetic networks and open-source easy-to-use publicly available software with broad applicability within evolutionary biology and systematics. [PhyloNetworks](https://github.com/crsl4/PhyloNetworks.jl) is the third most widely used Julia package in genomics, but its network inference method (SNaQ) is restricted to level-1 phylogenetic networks. As part of this project, we will extend the pseudolikelihood model within SNaQ to more complex networks and we will explore other divide-and-conquer strategies that would allow us to push the scalability limits on phylogenetic network inference.

#### Job duties
The primary duties of the postdoctoral researcher include but are not limited to: i) Develop novel statistical theory on identifiability and inference of complex classes of phylogenetic networks; ii) Implement the novel theory in open source software; iii) Design simulation studies to test the performance of the novel methods; iv) Write up research findings for presentations at scientific and lay meetings; v) Write up research findings for publication in peer-reviewed journals. The secondary duties include but are not limited to assisting with general lab activities, attending lab meetings, interacting with lab investigators/staff, helping mentor graduate and undergraduate students in the lab and executing other research-related tasks as determined by the supervising principal investigator (Solis-Lemus).

#### Other relevant qualifications
Knowledge of version control via git/github, interest in scientific communication (oral/written), interest in working independently as leader of the research project, but also as part of a collaborative team.

### How to apply

Send an email to solislemus AT wisc.edu with the following materials:
- CV
- short research statement describing past experience in phylogenetics (<1 page)
- two representative publications 
- contact info of two recommenders
- code sample (e.g. on github) showing work that you are proud of

**Deadline:** Candidates will be considered until position is filled.
